# Python
This here is all the Python stuff I've been working on. I've separated my programs that can qualify as programs and just general exercises to keep it clear for the reader. I'm in the process of editing the README's, so I apologize in advance.

# Why Does Github Tell Me This Repo Contains Almost 95% HTML?
That's a great question. This is because some of the Python programs I build generate output files that have tons of HTML code due to certain modules' usage. 

Prime Offenders: Folium & Bokeh

Folium generates Leaflet maps in HTML while Bokeh generates Data Visualizations via HTML too.
