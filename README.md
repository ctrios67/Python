# Python
This here is all the Python stuff I've been working on. I've separated my programs that can qualify as programs and just general exercises to keep it clear for the reader. I'm in the process of editing the README's, so I apologize in advance.

# Which OS are you using?
My OS is Windows 10. I am developing in Python 3.8 at the time of this writing, using Atom as an IDE (it is awesome!), and git bash for any actual executions.
