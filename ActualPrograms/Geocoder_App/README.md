## Synopsis

This is an application where the user can upload a CSV file that contains a column named "Address" or "address"
and the application will geocode the addresses in that column, append the Latitude & Longitude as new columns in the
CSV file, display the new CSV in the webpage, and allow the user to download the new file.

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

The end of a Udemy course I am taking challenges the student to complete this task with as minimal as resources as
possible. This app combines almost everything I have learned in that course and since I went into this course knowing
jack squat about Python, I figured I'd see if I can make this!

## Installation

Just clone this git repo after installing the dependencies pandas, flask, & geopy via pip or pip3.
