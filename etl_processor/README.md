## Synopsis

This is a piece of code that will act as a simple ETL job, and hopefully demonstrates to myself, an understanding
of Database connectivity using Python, and how to interact with it properly.

## Code Example

## Motivation

My normal day-to-day job currently has me using Oracle's ETL offering (which is technically an ELT tool).
I haven't dabbled in Python code for quite some time, and I know it's capable of acting as an ETL tool,
so I want to test the capabilities of it performing some simple options I deal with.
